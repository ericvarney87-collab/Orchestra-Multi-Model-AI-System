# Orchestra-Multi-Model-AI-System
Orchestra is the first practical orchestration framework for local language models that combines multiple specialized small models in parallel, dynamically scores and selects the best outputs, and delivers them through a user-friendly interface. Unlike monolithic LLMs, it achieves faster responses, lower hardware demands, and modular scalability.

# Orchestra

A deterministic, non-autonomous orchestration system for local language models.

## What it does
- Coordinates multiple specialized models without emergence
- Runs fully local via Ollama
- Deterministic execution paths (no agent autonomy)
- Designed for control and privacy, not creativity
